trainsum
========

Welcome to **trainsum**, a Python package designed for working with quantics tensor trains.
The development was done by the ZAQC-team at the Fraunhofer Institute for Graphical Data Analysis (IGD).
**trainsum** is licensed under EUPL 1.2 (similar to GPL).

The main features are:
    - easy definition of **N-dimensional** tensor trains
    - **quantization** of dimensions independent of their size
    - **einsum**-operations equivalent to NumPy's einsum function
    - generic **backends** for NumPy, Torch and CuPy
    - tensorized **solver** for eigenvalue equations and linear equation systems
